### Pricing:
I think we say $300/hr
[See table](https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-top-management-consulting-firms-charge-clients-per-consultant
) on billable hours near bottom of 1st answer


### Who Does What
We all do whatever we can to get this going asap, but I
Think of a useful cost and other ways of getting our name out there.
think we all curate and work together on finding the right services to offer and 
agree on the layout (JP will build the site).
Perhaps Marc can design the adwords, think of a useful cost and other ways of getting our name out there.

*I don’t know how to implement adwords stuff but I could learn pretty quickly so am happy to do this and I think I still
have the R600 of adwords that google is always offering me.*
Maybe there are tenders we can do. I have a corporation that we can use to bill.

*I wonder if there is a non-government tender listing anywhere for bidding on work. 
Or maybe we list on freelancer.com or something? But I know those jobs don’t pay well so probably not a good idea.*

*I also think that the way we’d probably get our first client is through a friend of a friend or some sort of network. 
I know that in general in any starting business “work comes from work” so getting the
first client is the most important because it leads to referrals.*

### Things to be done
- Figure out how we bill (I guess it depends where our customers are).
- Find some templates/ strategies online for the output of the work done.
- Just find some clients (secure some contracts). 

*I guess we have to really work out what percentage of the work done goes to the person doing the work and what goes to the company. I was putting 20% on top of the work for my company and it was never profitable at that margin, so probably a minimun of 25% of every bill should go to the company. Then tax should probably be assumed to be the highest bracket (or around 40% and structure from there?)*

*I’ve used wave accounting before which is free and can track cost/billing break downs. And if we were to open a business bank account at some point it links securely and the accounting, invoicing and follow ups is all automated.*

### Services on offer:

Writing this as a first pass, it seems silly, but hopefully I will iterate and improve it.

*These seem good as offerings to me but maybe they are too jargony, I really don't know? Let me know what you think of saying something like: "Analyse your business securely to see where you're wasting resources." Anyway I think I'm just a noob at this kind of stuff and people will know what they are looking for. These are just my thoughts to open discussion and make the best choices.*
