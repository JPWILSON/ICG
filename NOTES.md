### Pricing:
I think we say $300/hr
[See table](https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-top-management-consulting-firms-charge-clients-per-consultant
) on billable hours near bottom of 1st answer


### Who Does What
We all do whatever we can to get this going asap, but I
think we all curate and work together on finding the right services to offer and
agree on the layout (JP will build the site)
Perhaps Marc can design the adwords. *I don’t know how to implement adwords stuff but I could learn pretty quickly so am happy to do this and I think I still have the R600 of adwords that google is always offering me.* 

Think of a useful cost and other ways of getting our name out there.
Maybe there are tenders we can do. I have a corporation that we can use to bill.

*I wonder if there is a non-government tender listing anywhere for bidding on work. Or maybe we list on freelancer.com or something? But I know those jobs don’t pay well so probably not a good idea.*

*I also think that the way we’d probably get our first client is through a friend of a friend or some sort of network. I know that in general in any starting business “work comes from work” so getting the first client is the most important because it leads to referrals.*

### Things to be done
Figure out how we bill (I guess it depends where our customers are)
Find some templates/ strategies online for the output of the work done

*I guess we have to really work out what percentage of the work done goes to the person doing the work and what goes to the company. I was putting 20% on top of the work for my company and it was never profitable at that margin, so probably a minimun of 25% of every bill should go to the company. Then tax should probably be assumed to be the highest bracket (or around 40% and structure from there?)*

*I’ve used wave accounting before which is free and can track cost/billing break downs. And if we were to open a business bank account at some point it links securely and the accounting, invoicing and follow ups is all automated.*

### Services on offer:

Writing this as a first pass, it seems silly, but hopefully I will iterate and improve it.

*These seem good as offerings to me but maybe they are too jargony, I really don't know? Let me know what you think of saying something like: "Analyse your business securely to see where you're wasting resources." Anyway I think I'm just a noob at this kind of stuff and people will know what they are looking for. These are just my thoughts to open discussion and make the best choices.*

    - Business Process Modelling
    - Analytics (PowerBI and Tableau)
    - I am sure there are many things here:
        optimization
        process mapping
        uncovering insights
    (- I think we should add basic web business services like websites, email marketing, and seo)

    - Options for renewables

    - Drawings for home projects
    - Designs for modifications
    - Solution development for any home/ small office projects?
